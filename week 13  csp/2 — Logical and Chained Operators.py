# Objective:
# Students will use logical (and, or, not) and chained comparison operators in Python to build compound conditions.

# Key Notes:

# and → Both conditions must be True

# or → At least one condition must be True

# not → Inverts True/False

# You can chain comparisons: 1 < x < 5

# Examples:
x = 10
print(x > 5 and x < 15)   # True
print(x < 5 or x == 10)   # True
print(not(x == 10))       # False
print(1 < x < 20)         # True


#score calculator
score = int(input("Enter your score (0-100):"))
# if 90 <= score <= 100:
#     print("Grade: A")

# if 80 <= score <= 89:
#     print("Grade: B")

# if 70 <= score <= 79:
#     print("Grade: C")

# if 60 <= score <= 69:
#     print("Grade: D")
    
# if 0 <= score <= 59:
#     print("Grade: F")

if score >= 90 and score <= 100:
    print("Grade: A")
elif score >= 80 and score < 90:
    print("Grade: B")
elif score >= 70 and score < 80:
    print("Grade: C")
if score >= 60 and score < 70:
    print("Grade: D")
elif score < 60:
    print("Grade: F") 


# Practice Problems:

# Write an expression that checks if a number is between 50 and 100 (inclusive).

number = int(print("What is your number?"))

print(50 <= x <= 100)

# Write an expression that checks if a number is NOT equal to 0 and greater than 10.
y = int(input("Enter another number:"))
print(y !=0 and y >10)
# Use chained comparison to check if 3 < 4 < 5.
print(3<4<5)
